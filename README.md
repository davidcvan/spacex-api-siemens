I have created simple terminal application per Your request, the application is divided to 4 main packages *controllers, views, models* and *main*
## Packages
### Main
This package is used to run the application, it just prints the main menu.
### Controllers
This package is used mainlz to proccess the data that come from the API, it handles all GET requests and all the data that is printed to the console comes from one of this package`s functions
### Models
This package is used only to create the structs for parsing the JSON data from API
### Views
This package handles all the prints and outputs to console, it also handles the options You choose in the main menu
